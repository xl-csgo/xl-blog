In 2020, I participated in an online cryptic hunt and won a free domain name as a prize. And after spending months unable to decide what to put on here, I eventually just downloaded a template from [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net), and created a blog. With the end of the pandemic nowhere in sight, many—including myself—had turned to gaming as their means of escape. 

And Counter-Strike, a game I essentially stumbled onto thanks to a single session at the local LAN cafe years ago, became my playground of choice. So, as my understanding of the game's history developed through countless hours spent pouring through Liquipedia pages, Thorin videos, and WarOwl match breakdowns, I decided to use this blog as a way to combine my "creative writing" chops with my burgeoning passion for this video game. 

While I only ever managed 6 posts on the original blog, it sparked something that would last far longer. In 2021, as the pandemic continued, I finally found myself free from the time commitments of virtual high school, and I found an opening at a site called Gamezo, to write about Counter-Strike. What better way to spend countless hours while my future figured itself out, I thought, so I sent in my application. 

Over the past five years, I've published 19 articles at Gamezo, hundreds more at Esports.gg, and Dust2.in, and worked with other publications on shorter stints. And now I'm back, writing full time after completing my degree. My passion for my work is higher than ever, and for the stories/ideas that don't earn a full-fledged article on Dot Esports, I'm bringing back this blog. 

From random Counter-Strike thoughts, and discussions on the world of Esports as a whole, to my Formula 1 musings—because there's something captivating about watching terabytes of data influencing strategy as drivers lap at over 300 kmph—this will be the one place for all my thoughts. And we'll be starting things off with a Formula 1 article, coming January 1, 2026.
